# Morse_Code

This is a Morse Code communicator. Messages are sent between computer and Arduino.

Communicators: Java & Arduino C

Purpose: Java will send data to the Arduino, and the Arduino will process those bytes and display their contents in Morse code. Morse code is an example of a substitution cipher because individual letters are replaced by a specific, fixed Morse code.
